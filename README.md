# Basic-JS-Calculator

Iv been focusing alot on different languages for work and havent had to much time
to spend with JS. So I wanted to just build out a smaller JavaScript application.
This application will be very simple. It will take in two numbers, calculate it 
based on the math operator clicked and give a response.
